## Usage

When a restaurant owner logs in or signs up  using a valid email and password, they are taken to a dashboard which displays existing projects, if there are any, and a button "Create New Project". When the user clicks the button to create a new project, they are taken through a series of forms to collect basic info, menu info, and additional info including hours of operation. The application collects this information and then creates a customized wesite for the user. This website has its own unique url and can be shared with the public. The project can also then be found easily on the users dashboard.
